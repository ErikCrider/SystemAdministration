Migrate files to Sharepoint

This script moves files to a sharepoint site from local files or file servers.
Script goes to the local files then to the Sharepoint site to see if these files already exist in that location
If files already reside in SP, it will not copy them again. If no files are in SP it will copy all files.

This creates a transcript on the desktop which is useful for recording any files that failed to transfer.

Limitations: Currently this script does not deal with subfolders.

Prerequisites:
PNP.Powershell module
    Find-module PNP.Powershell | install-module
Edit permissions to Sharepoint site and at least read permissions on local files
